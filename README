lsf-graphs

Preface:
This code is based on code from passrafi's lsf-stats ( https://github.com/passrafi/lsf-stats ), though, I only blatantly copy a few of his functions and fix a few others. Given this, I'm releasing this code under the MIT license, as most of the implementation is obvious, given an example, and a large portion of the code is different from his code and more specific to this purpose.
If there are any issues, please create an issue on this repo

Install:
The db folder contains the database structure and an example script to push a name dictionary from a list of users and projects into it

The backend folder contains the code which utilizes the LSF Python API ( https://github.com/PlatformLSF/platform-python-lsf-api ) to push job data into the database
This code will need some tweaking for your system.
It is designed to run on Python ~2.7 on CentOS 6 plus or minus a bit.
Ultimately, you'll just run go-mysql.sh in a screen, or, run the script that go-mysql.sh runs, perhaps through cron.. often.. like every minute.

The web folder contains the frontend code to make the graphs and pull data from the backend.
The php script that pulls from the db may not be very safe. SQL injections have not been looked into.
It does not scale.. there is no cache to not pull from DB. Hard requests could be stacked and kill the web or DB server.
The front end should store state somewhere instead of pulling the same JSON data for each type of graph.. it's not efficient.
The 10 minute auto refresh is in there incase you want to do maintenance or if there is a memory leak.. that way the page can run for a long time and still be OK.
